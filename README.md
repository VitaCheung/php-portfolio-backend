This is a Content Management System (CMS) of my portfolio site, which included a login process, dashboard, projects, skills and experience management. Tables and relationships were created through the Laravel Migration files and stored in the database. The CRUD processes are supported by the Controllers and Views. All CMS data is available as JSON using the Laravel API routes. 

My portfolio site is constructed using React with the API built in this CMS.
